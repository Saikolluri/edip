# Explainable Decision Impact Platform (EDIP)

EDIP is a rule-based, explainable decision intelligence system that evaluates business actions against regulatory obligations and returns clear, auditable insights.

This project focuses on **trust, traceability, and explainability**, rather than black-box AI outputs.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Organizations often take business actions (e.g., collecting user data) without clearly understanding:
- Regulatory impact
- Risk level
- Applicable laws and clauses
- Why a decision is considered risky

Most tools provide conclusions without reasoning.

## ✅ Solution

EDIP analyzes a business action using:
- Industry
- Location
- Action type

It then returns:
- Risk level (Low / Medium / High)
- Applicable regulation
- Clause reference
- Human-readable explanation
- Audit note for traceability
